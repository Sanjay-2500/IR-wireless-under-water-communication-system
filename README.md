IR wireless under water communication system



: Underwater wireless communications system
comprising first and second communications modules
which transmit and receive data utilizing infrared
radiation. Each module has a transmitter/receiver which
converts each received data. The infrared light detecting
unit then provides a logic zero at its output when it
receives a pulsed burst of infrared radiation for time
period of approximately six hundred microseconds and a
logic one when the unit fails to detect a pulsed burst of
infrared radiation for a time period of six hundred
microseconds. Wireless infrared (IR) communication
system is meant to use free space propagation of light
waves as a transmission medium in near infrared band.
Message communication is implemented by using IR as a
source that is established a light communication (link to
transmit and receive data via infrared light). The outcome
of this proposed work is to design and implementation an
optical wireless system to transmit data over a certain
distance. This system has many advantages such as is an
inexpensive and the transmitter or receiver can be showed
to another location with least distraction. This system is
used for easy communication with transmitter and
receiver in underground water. if they need any help
means the transmit the signal using IR transmitter remote
the signal transfer to IR receiver circuit. So thus, why they
can easily identify the information.
